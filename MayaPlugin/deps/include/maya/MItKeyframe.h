//! \brief  Keyframe Iterator 
/*!
Iterate over the keyframes of a particular Anim Curve Node, and query
and edit the keyframe to which the iterator points.

Determine the time and value of the keyframe, as well as the x,y values
and type of the tangent to the curve entering (in tangent) and leaving
(out tangent) the keyframe.

Set the time and value of the keyframe, and the type of the tangents.

Anim Curves are implemented as Dependency Graph (DG) Nodes. Each Node has
multiple ordered and indexed keyframes.

Use the Keyframe Iterator to systematically visit, and query and/or edit the
keyframes of a Anim Curve Node.

Use the Keyframe Iterator in conjunction with the Anim Curve Function Set
(MFnAnimCurve) to edit Anim Curve Nodes.

On creation the iterator is attached to a Anim Curve Node.  The
iterator may be detached from its current Node and attached to another
Anim Curve Node using the reset() method.

Though keyframes within a Node are ordered and indexed, the iterator
maintains the index of the current Node internally and does not export
it.  Use the Anim Curve Function Set to access the index for a
keyframe.  The index is zero-based.  When an iterator is first
attached to a Node, either on creation or reset, the index is set to
zero.  There is an overloaded version of the reset() method which does
not cause the iterator to change Nodes, but merely resets the index.

Use the next(), reset() and isDone() methods to perform iterations.

Use the specific query methods to determine the time, value and
tangent information for the keyframe under the iterator.

Use specific edit methods to set the time and value , as well as the
incoming and outgoing tangent type (MItKeyframe::TangentType) of the
keyframe under the iterator.

There is no method for setting the x,y value of either of the
tangents.

Setting the time of a keyframe will fail if the new time would require
a re-ordering of the keyframes.  Use the Anim Curve Functiion Set
methods MFnAnimCurve::remove() and MFnAnimCurve::addKeyFrame() to
re-order the keyframes.

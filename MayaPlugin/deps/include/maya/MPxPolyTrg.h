//! \brief User defined poly triangulation support.
/*!
<b>MPxPolyTrg</b> is the the parent class for nodes which define
a custom  face triangulation for meshes. In order to override
default maya triangulation, the user has to do the following
things:

<ul><!--\
--><li> Derive a new node from <b>MPxPolyTrg</b> class.

<li> Define a static function on the new node to
triangulate a single face in the mesh. The signature
of this function is given by <b>polyTrgFnct</b> type.\n
The input to the triangulation function is:
    <ul>
	<li> *vert  - pointer to an array of vertex positions
                   for the face. It size is 3*nbVertices.
	<li> *norm  - pointer to an array of per vertex normals
                   for the face. It size is 3*nbVertices.
	<li> *loopSizes - pointer to an array of loop sizes.
                       The size of this array is <b>nbLoops</b>
	<li> nbLoops - number of loops in the face.
	<li> nbTrg   - expected number of triangles to be
                    generated.
	</ul>

    Note: The number of vertices can be calculated by adding all the loop sizes.\n
	The output of this function is an array of triangle description:

    <ul>
	<li> *trg - pointer to an integer array.\n
	            This array is already allocated with the size of 3*nbTrg.\n
                It has to be filled with the triangle descriptions given by the 
				face-relative position of vertices i.e.\n\n
					nbTrg = 2\n
                    trg: 0 1 2 2 3 0\n
		<!--\
		-->
		Tip: Refer to the example plugin: <b>polyTrgNode</b> for
		more details on how to implement it.
	</ul>
<li> Register that function when the node is created
for the first time (in the postConstructor() method)
by calling the <b>registerTrgFunction()</b>.

<li> Unregister the function in the destructor by calling
the <b>unregisterTrgFunction()</b>.
</ul>

Once the node is defined, the user has to inform the mesh
about it. For each mesh the user wants to override the
default triangulation, he has to set the <b>usertTrg</b>
attribute on the mesh to the name under which the function
has been registered.

Example:
\code{.mel}
        setAttr mesh.userTrg -type "string" "triangulate";
\endcode

Once that attribute is set, the default maya triangulation
is turned off and the one provided by the user is used to
draw the mesh.

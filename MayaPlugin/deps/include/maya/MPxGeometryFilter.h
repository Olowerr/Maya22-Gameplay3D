//! \brief Base class for user-defined deformers 
/*!
 MPxGeometryFilter allows the creation of user-defined deformers.  A deformer
 is a node which takes any number of input geometries, deforms them, and
 places the output into the output geometry attribute.

 If you write a deformer by deriving from MPxGeometryFilter, your deformer will
 derive the benefit of Maya's internal deformer functionality, namely:

   \li The Set Editing Tool and the Set Editor Window can be used to modify the membership of the deformer.
   \li "Has No Effect" mode is implemented in the base class, and disables the node.
   \li When the deformer node is deleted, its inputs and outputs will be correctly reconnected in the dependency graph.
   \li Reordering of the deformer node with other deformers via the Complete List window.
   \li Placement and connection of the deformer node in the dependency graph via the "deformer -type" command. The deformer command also has the standard deformer options such as exclusive membership and parallel mode.


 Deformers are full dependency nodes and can have attributes and a
 deform() method. In general, to derive the full benefit of the Maya
 deformer base class, it is suggested that you do not write your own
 compute() method. Instead, write the deform() method, which is called
 by the MPxGeometryFilter's compute() method. However, there are some
 exceptions when you would instead write your own compute(), namely:

   \li Your node's deformation algorithm depends on the geometry type, which is not available in the deform() method.
   \li Your node's deformation algorithm requires computing all of the output geometries simultaneously.


In the case where you cannot simply override the deform() method, the
following example code shows one possible compute() method
implementation. This compute() example creates an iterator for the deformer
set corresponding to the output geometry being computed. Note that this
sample compute() implementation does not do any deformation, and does
not implement handling of the nodeState attribute. If you do choose to
override compute() in your node, there is no reason to implement the
deform() method, since it will not be called by the base class.

\code
MStatus exampleDeformer::compute(const MPlug& plug, MDataBlock& dataBlock)
{
    MStatus status = MStatus::kUnknownParameter;
 	if (plug.attribute() == outputGeom) {
		// get the input corresponding to this output
		//
		unsigned int index = plug.logicalIndex();
		MObject thisNode = this->thisMObject();
		MPlug inPlug(thisNode,input);
		inPlug.selectAncestorLogicalIndex(index,input);
		MDataHandle hInput = dataBlock.inputValue(inPlug);

		// get the input geometry and input groupId
		//
		MDataHandle hGeom = hInput.child(inputGeom);
		MDataHandle hOutput = dataBlock.outputValue(plug);
		hOutput.copy(hGeom);

		// Get the iterator (either from groupIds or componentTags)
		MItGeometry iter;
		getGeometryIterator(iter, dataBlock, hOutput, index, false);

		// do the deformation
		//
		for ( ; !iter.isDone(); iter.next()) {
			MPoint pt = iter.position();

			//
            // insert deformation code here
			//

			iter.setPosition(pt);
		}
		status = MStatus::kSuccess;
	}
	return status;
}
\endcode

For most deformers, implementing compute() is unnecessary. To create a
deformer, derive from this class and override the deform() method as
demonstrated in the "offsetNode.cpp" example plug-in.  The other
methods of the parent class MPxNode may also be overridden to perform
standard dependency node capabilities.

When implementing the compute method for a
deformer, another consideration is that the input geometry attribute is not
cached. This means that all of the inputs will evaluate each time
MDataBlock::inputArrayValue is called on "inputGeom". If you only want
a single inputGeometry, you can prevent unneeded evaluations by avoiding
calls to MDataBlock.inputArrayValue. For example, use the technique shown in the
above example or use MDataBlock::outputArrayValue.

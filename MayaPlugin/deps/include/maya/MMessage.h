//! \brief Message base class.
/*!
	This is the base class for message callbacks. This base class allows the
	user to remove a message callback.  To register a callback, the user must
	use the addCallback methods in the message classes which inherit from this
	base class.

	When a callback is added a number or id is returned. This id is used to
	keep track of the callback and is necessary for removing it.
	A callback id with the value 'NULL' represents an invalid callback.
	Use	the removeCallback member function of this class for removing a
	callback.

	It is the user's responsibility to keep track of the callback id's
	and remove all callbacks for a plug-in when it is unloaded.

	<b>Callbacks During File Read</b>

	Care must be taken when a callback executes while Maya is reading a
	scene file as the scene may be temporarily in an inconsistent state,
	which could give incorrect results.

	For example, consider a scene which has two nodes, X and Y, with a
	connection from <i>X.out</i> to <i>Y.in</i>. A "node added" message
	(see MDGMessage::addNodeAddedCallback) will be sent out for Y as soon
	as it is added to the scene, but before the connection has been made
	to <i>Y.in</i>. If a callback were to read the value of <i>Y.in</i> at
	this point it would get the wrong result.

	The difficulties are compounded by the fact that Maya's normal
	Dependency Graph evaluation and dirty propagation mechanisms are
	disabled during a file read. In our example above, retrieving the
	value of <i>Y.in</i> will mark the plug as clean. When the connection
	is from <i>X.out</i> is subsequently made, Y.in won't be marked dirty
	because dirty propagation is disabled. As a result, when the file read
	has completed and Maya draws the new scene, <i>Y.in</i> will not be
	re-evaluated which may produce an error in the draw.

	For these reasons, callbacks should avoid querying or modifying the DG
	in any way during file read. They should not add or remove nodes, make
	or break connections, change parenting, set or retrieve plug values,
	etc. Even something as innocuous as a call to
	MFnDagNode::isIntermediateObject may cause problems since it queries
	the value of the node's <i>intermediateObject</i> plug. All such
	actions should be postponed until the file read has completed.

//
// CLASS DESCRIPTION (MPxObjectSet)
//
//  MPxObjectSet is the parent class of all user defined object sets.
//  User defined sets are dependency nodes.
//
//  This class can be used to implement new kinds of sets within maya that
//  can have selectable/manipulatable components and behave in a similar
//  manner to the objectSet node included in maya.
